# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to automate the detection of heart disease in patients by analyzing their medical data using various machine learning algorithms. By predicting the presence of heart disease, hospitals can improve early diagnosis and patient care.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle - Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). It contains patient records with features relevant to cardiovascular health and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading, exploring, cleaning, and scaling features.
- **Train-Test Split:** Dividing the dataset into training and evaluation sets.
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.

## Results
All models were compared based on their performance metrics. The results help identify the most effective algorithm for predicting heart disease, assisting healthcare professionals in early intervention.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main notebook or script to train models and evaluate results.
